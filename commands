in the directory:
$ mvn clean
to clean the project
$ mvn compile
-> will generate the bytecode in ./target/classes
$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
-> will put all necessary libraries in ./target/dependency
$ java -cp "./target/classes:./target/dependency/*" ShaclTest
will execute from the library, notice that I had to indicate where to find the class files and the dependency
